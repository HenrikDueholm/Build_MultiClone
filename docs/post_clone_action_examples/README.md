# Post Clone Action examples

Add a ".postcloneactions"-file to the root of a repository to enable post clone actions.
These actions are performed after cloning of targets and dependencies has been completed.

## Use 

- Copy the example to the root of a repository
- Modify the file name so it is ".postcloneactions"
- Commit, push and re-clone to see the effect of the ".postcloneactions"
